        "Q1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        "\n",
        "- A RESTful API is an application programming interface that follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer), a set of architectural guidelines for designing web services. It allows different software systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', and 'DELETE'. In a RESTful API, resources (such as users, products, or posts) are identified by unique URLs, and each request is stateless, meaning the server does not store information about the client’s previous requests. The client and server operate independently, interacting through these APIs without the server needing to know anything about the client beyond the current request. RESTful APIs return data in formats like JSON or XML and use standard HTTP response codes (such as '200 OK', 404 Not Found, or '500 Internal Server Error') to indicate the outcome of a request. This makes RESTful APIs simple, flexible, and widely used for building scalable web and mobile applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "\n",
        "- An API specification is a detailed, structured description of how an Application Programming Interface (API) works — it defines how clients (such as apps or services) should interact with the API. It acts like a contract between the API provider and the consumer, outlining exactly what endpoints are available, what inputs (parameters, headers, body data) are expected, what outputs (response formats, status codes) will be returned, and what rules or behaviors the API follows.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flask is a lightweight, open-source Python web framework that makes it easy to build web applications and APIs. It was designed to be simple, flexible, and minimalistic, allowing developers to create web services quickly without unnecessary complexity. Flask is often described as a \"micro-framework\" because it doesn’t come with built-in features like authentication, database ORM, or form handling — instead, it gives you the essentials and lets you add only what you need using extensions.\n",
        "- Why is Flask popular for building APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " Simplicity & minimalism:\n",
        "Flask has a clean, easy-to-understand structure. You can create a working API with just a few lines of code.\n",
        "\n",
        " Flexibility:\n",
        "You can structure your API however you want. Flask doesn’t force a specific project layout or design pattern, giving you full control.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Flask, routing refers to the process of mapping URLs (web addresses) to specific functions in your application, which are called view functions or route handlers. When a user or client sends a request to a particular URL, Flask uses the defined routes to determine which function should handle that request and generate a response. Routes are created using the '@app.route()' decorator, where you specify the URL pattern and optionally the HTTP methods (such as 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE) that the route should accept. This allows you to design clean and organized web APIs or web pages, where each URL corresponds to a specific resource or action. For example, you can define /api/users' to handle requests related to users or '/api/products' for product-related actions. Flask's routing system makes it easy to build RESTful APIs by associating URLs and HTTP methods with the appropriate logic in your Python code.\n",

        "Q7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The '@app.route()' decorator in Flask is used to map a specific URL to a Python function, allowing your application to respond to requests sent to that URL. When a client accesses the URL, Flask calls the associated function and returns its output as the response. This decorator helps define routes for different parts of your web app or API and can also specify which HTTP methods (like 'GET' or 'POST') the route should handle.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        "- The main difference between GET and POST HTTP methods lies in how they send data and their intended purpose. GET is used to retrieve data from the server without making any changes; it sends data (like query parameters) in the URL, which makes it visible and suitable for safe, repeatable requests such as fetching a webpage or resource. POST, on the other hand, is used to send data to the server to create or process something, such as submitting a form or creating a new record. It sends data in the request body, keeping it hidden from the URL and allowing larger or more sensitive data to be transmitted. Additionally, GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, while POST requests cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9.  How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "- In Flask APIs, errors are handled by returning meaningful responses with proper HTTP status codes and messages. You can do this by manually returning error responses in your routes, using '@app.errorhandler' to define custom handlers for common errors (like 404 or 500), or using 'abort()' to trigger HTTP exceptions. You can also use try-except blocks to catch and handle specific errors inside your functions. This helps ensure the API gives clear and useful feedback to clients when something goes wrong.\n",

        "Q10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database?\n",
        "\n",
        "- To connect Flask to a SQL database, you typically use an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) like SQLAlchemy, or you can use a database connector directly. The most common approach is with Flask-SQLAlchemy, which integrates SQLAlchemy into Flask.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Flask blueprints are a way to organize and structure large Flask applications by breaking them into smaller, reusable, and modular components. A blueprint acts like a mini-application: it can contain routes, templates, static files, and other logic. Instead of defining all routes and views in a single file, you can group related functionality (such as admin, user, or API sections) into separate blueprints and then register them on the main app.\n",

        "\n",
        "- The Flask 'request' object is used to access all the data sent by a client in an HTTP request. It allows your application to easily read form data, JSON payloads, query parameters, headers, cookies, and uploaded files. The 'request' object also provides information about the request itself, such as the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), the URL, and the client’s IP address. This makes it possible for your Flask app to process user input, handle API calls, and respond appropriately based on what the client sends.\n",

        "Q19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "- HTTP status codes are standardized 3-digit numbers that a server (like a Flask API) sends back with a response to indicate the result of the client’s request. They help clients (such as browsers, apps, or other services) understand whether a request was successful, failed, or needs special handling.\n",
        "\n",
        " Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        " 200 OK — The request was successful.\n",
        "\n",
        " 201 Created — A new resource was successfully created.\n",
        "\n",
        " 400 Bad Request — The client sent invalid data.\n",
        "\n",
        " 404 Not Found — The requested resource doesn’t exist.\n",
        "\n",
        " 500 Internal Server Error — Something went wrong on the server.\n",
        "\n",
        " Importance:\n",
        "* Provides clear feedback to the client about what happened.\n",
        "* Helps API consumers handle responses properly (e.g., retry, show error).\n",
        "* Follows web standards, improving compatibility and reliability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Flask, POST requests are handled by defining a route that explicitly allows the 'POST' method using the '@app.route()' decorator with 'methods=['POST']'. Inside the route function, you can access the data sent by the client using the 'request' object. For example, if the client sends JSON data, you can use 'request.get_json()' to retrieve it, or if form data is sent, you can use 'request.form'. After processing the data, the server usually returns a response using 'jsonify()' along with an appropriate HTTP status code, such as '201 Created' to indicate that the data was successfully received or a resource was created. This allows the API to effectively handle client submissions, such as creating new records or processing form inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. How would you secure a Flask API?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Authentication and Authorization** — Use methods like API keys, tokens (e.g., JWT), or OAuth to ensure only authorized users can access certain endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Input validation and sanitization** — Always validate and sanitize data received from clients to prevent attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).\n",
        "\n",
        "* **HTTPS** — Serve your API over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect it from interception.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Rate limiting** — Implement rate limiting (using tools like 'Flask-Limiter') to prevent abuse or denial-of-service attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** — Configure CORS properly to control which domains can access your API.\n",

        "* **Error handling** — Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages; provide generic error responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Secure session and cookie settings** — If your API uses sessions, enable flags like 'HttpOnly' and 'Secure' for cookies.\n",
